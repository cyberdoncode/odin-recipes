        <p>Chef Johnâ€™s chicken saltimbocca is a next-level flavorful way to prepare chicken<br>
            breasts. The quick and easy pan sauce is optional, but really elevates the dish,<br>
            and a tangy salad of bitter greens and radish makes a fresh contrast between<br>
            bites.
        </p>
        <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><p>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</p></li>
            <li><p>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p></li>
            <li><p>4 to 8 sage leaves, or as needed</p></li>
            <li><p>3 thin slices prosciutto</p></li>
            <li><p>2 tablespoons olive oil</p></li>
            <li><p>2 tablespoons Marsala wine or white wine</p></li>
            <li><p>1/2 lemon, juiced</p></li>
            <li><p>1/3 cup chicken broth</p></li>
            <li><p>2 tablespoons cold unsalted butter</p></li>
            <li><p>2 lemon wedges (optional)</p></li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Place chicken breasts between 2 sheets of heavy plastic on a solid, level surface.<br>
                Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a 3/8-inch<br>
                thickness. Season lightly with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p></li>
            <li><p>With the smoother side of chicken breasts facing up, lay 2 to 4 sage leaves on<br>
                each breast; more sage leaves will give a stronger sage flavor. Then, cover<br>
                breasts with a single layer of prosciutto, covering the sage underneath.</p></li>
            <li><p>Lay a piece of plastic wrap on top, and press down firmly to flatten. Refrigerate<br>
                for about 30 minutes before cooking for best results.</p></li>
            <li><p>Heat olive oil in a nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken,<br>
                prosciutto-side down. in the pan, and sear until prosciutto is lightly browned,<br>
                about 3 minutes. Turn chicken over, and cook until chicken is no longer pink at<br>
                the center and juices run clear, about 3 minutes more. Exact time will depend on<br>
                size and thickness of chicken breasts.</p></li>
            <li><p>Turn off heat, remove chicken to a plate, and cover loosely with foil.</p></li>
            <li><p>For the sauce, add Marsala, lemon juice, and chicken broth to the pan, along<br>
                with any accumulated juices from the plate with chicken, and place back over<br>
                medium-high heat. Boil until reduced by half, about 3 minutes. Reduce heat to<br>
                low, and swirl in butter until it disappears.</p></li>
            <li><p>Spoon sauce generously over chicken saltimbocca and add a lemon wedge on<br>
            the side.</p></li>                
        </ol>

        <h4>Chef's Notes</h4>
        <p>Sauce is optional, and chicken can be served with just the pan drippings<br>
            spooned over the top.<br>
        </p>
        <p>Sage leaves can be placed on top of prosciutto, instead of underneath, for a<br>
            different, milder flavor. Or, after chicken is cooked, the sage can simply be<br>
            fried in the pan until crisp and used to top the plate.</p>
